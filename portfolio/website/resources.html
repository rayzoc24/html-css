        <div><h3>🔗 Extra Motivation</h3>
            <h4>🌟 Bill Gates – From Teen Coder to Tech Giant</h4>
            <p>Bill Gates started learning to code in high school on a computer that was far less powerful than today’s phones. He built his first program — a simple tic-tac-toe game — when he was just a teenager. That curiosity and persistence later grew into Microsoft, which changed how the whole world uses computers. His story shows how small projects can turn into something massive.</p>
            <h4>🚀 Mark Zuckerberg – From Dorm Room to Facebook</h4>
            <p>Mark Zuckerberg began coding in middle school, making simple programs like a messaging tool for his family. By college, he was building projects for fun, one of which became Facebook. His journey is proof that coding isn’t just about jobs — it’s about creating things people love to use</p>
            <h4>🔧 Reshma Saujani – Champion of Women Coders</h4>
            <p>Reshma didn’t start as a coder at all — she was a lawyer and politician. But she saw how few women were in programming and founded Girls Who Code. Now, she inspires thousands of young girls to pick up coding and build confidence, showing that it’s never too late to start.</p>
            <h4>✨ Tanmay Bakshi – The Young Prodigy</h4>
            <p>Tanmay, from India/Canada, started coding at age 5 and became one of the youngest app developers on the App Store by 9. By his teens, he was already working with AI at IBM and giving TED talks. His story proves that age doesn’t matter if you’re passionate about learning.</p>
            <h4>💡 Takeaway</h4>
            <p>What all these stories share is not genius-level intelligence, but curiosity and consistency. Each person started small — a game, a tool, a hobby project — and slowly built up. That’s the same first step available to anyone starting today.</p>
